    "<em>What excites me about Data Science is the ability to quantitatively see truth through large data sets. Opinions can be bought, media can be manipulated, but viewing and analyzing large sets of organic data delivers facts without the clutter of opinions and bias. While it's true that there can be bias skewing data in certain directions, and the data can be interpreted by humans in multiple ways to further agendas, it's up to data scientists to deliver as honest results as we possibly can without letting our opinions or judgements cloud the data.</em>"
